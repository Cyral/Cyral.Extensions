Cyral.Extensions
================

**Update 8/23/15:** This library is no longer maintained or used.

A once personal extension library focusing on collecting useful snippets of C# code. Because of my use of this in many other applications, I have released the source code.

Note that these extensions are built up from over the years as useful snippets I've found. I have/am trying to provide attribution back to the sources of these extensions.

Feel free to contribute.
